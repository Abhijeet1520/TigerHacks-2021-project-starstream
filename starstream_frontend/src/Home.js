          For thousands of years, people from every part of the world have been
          studying the stars. Ancient Egyptians and Babylonians to notable
          astronomers like Galileo and Carl Sagan have looked to the stars to
          try and understand our place in the universe and how it all works.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The hundreds of objects that have been seen in the night sky since
          ancient times, like planets, stars, and galaxies, have given people
          the foundation to research and learn. Today’s Astronomers would not
          know as much as they do without the study of these objects. But with
          light pollution increasing at a rate twice as fast as the world’s
          population, dimmer objects are vanishing from our view and studying
          astronomy, as an amateur or professional, is getting harder.

          As light pollution increases, skyglow from unshielded lights make the
