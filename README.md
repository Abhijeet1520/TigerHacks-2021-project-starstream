## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## 🔨 How we built it

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud

- We built Chem Learn's authentication system with Google Cloud's Firebase. We chose this because we wanted to make an application that was very very secure. We learned how robust & fast Google Cloud services are and seeing that Firebase had a free plan that was great for us student hackers, using Google Cloud was kind of a no-brainer. Additionally, Firebase Authentication provided a backend service, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries, and the ability to authenticate using passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and the like. Thus, implementation was easy and we are pretty sure we made it incredibly convenient for our users while keeping it secure.
- We are using Firestore as our primary database to store user login/sign up details and Chatroom conversations.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which I overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing the project under the given time frame

## 📖 What we learned

Working with three js and using echo3D

## 🚀 What's next for

- Add Virtual Reality (VR) functionality
- Add more subjects and Customized 3D model
